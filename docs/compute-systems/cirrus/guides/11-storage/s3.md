# CIRRUS S3 Storage

To help enable cloud native application development there is a S3 compatible storage system on site that can be used from CIRRUS. This is an object storage system and does not provide a POSIX compliant file system.

The system provides HA object storage that is replicated between ML and NWSC. If a site goes down then objects will continue to be available. S3 systems are most often accessed programatically and at this time we do not offer any GUI browsability of buckets and objects.

## Access

Open a jira ticket or email cirrus-admin@ucar.edu for credentials to the system.

## Endpoint

https://s3.k8s.ucar.edu:5443

## Access Methods

S3 was created by Amazon AWS and is a way to access objects over http calls. Thus it can be access via curl but that is tedious.

### Bash

To access S3 via a bash/sh/csh/etc CLI it is best to use a widely available CLI utility such as the `aws` CLI provided by Amazon or an open source project such as `s5cmd`.

__AWS CLI__

[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

The official documentation is the best way to familiarize yourself with this tool. You will use the `s3` subcomamnd to work with objects. [AWS CLI S3 Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/). The --endpoint-url option will be used with a value of endpoint from above.

The aws command needs to be initially configured with credentials see the `aws configure` subcommand documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

Profiles and credentials can be set up manually via the `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` files.

```
# Example of ~/.aws/config file using cirrus as the default
[default]
endpoint_url = https://s3.k8s.ucar.edu:5443
```

```
# Example of ~/.aws/credentials file 
# this is where the credentials from the cirrus team are used

[default]
aws_access_key_id=ASDF1234
aws_secret_access_key=JKL987
```

When using either `aws` or `s5cmd` you need to use an additional flags --endpoint-url=https://s3.k8s.ucar.edu:5443. 

__s5cmd__

[s5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd)

s5cmd is a community project for interacting with s3 resources. It uses the same configuration files above. Generally it is much faster than `aws` cli or `s3cmd` project. This is our recommended method for accessing S3 objects.

### Python

There are many libraries that can access s3 resources but the aws official boto3 is often the best way to go about it.
